		<h1>KDRenewable</h1>
		<p><code>KDRenewable</code> ensures that a supply of an object is always available to the player. Whenever the player's inventory stack count of the object drops below a threshold, a new instance of the object is created at the <code>KDRenewable</code> marker's position. Only one new instance may exist at a time, so another will not be created until the previous one has been picked up or destroyed.</p>
		<p>The renewable object is identified by a <code>ScriptParams</code> link from the <code>KDRenewable</code> marker to an archetype. This script correctly handles the standard T2 crystal types, looking for the corresponding arrows in inventory. It also correctly handles archetypes (or their parents) with <code>Transmute</code> links, as used by the <a href="http://dromed.whoopdedo.org/public_scripts/transmogrify"><code>Transmogrify</code></a> script in Public Scripts.</p>
		<p>Only one <code>ScriptParams</code> link may exist from the marker. The data of that link must be the stack count threshold: the maximum amount of the object that can be in the player's inventory.</p>
		<p>By default, the inventory check is performed every 180 seconds (three minutes). If the inventory stack count is below the threshold and any previously created instance has been consumed, a new instance is created. To change the delay between checks, set the <code>Script\Timing</code> property to a different amount of time, in seconds.</p>
		<p>The new instance is created without a physics model or velocity, so the marker should be positioned and rotated appropriately for the object being created.</p>
		<p class="notice">This script is a replacement for the <code>RenewableResource</code> script in T2's <code>miss16.osm</code>, whose additional behaviors can lead to bugs in missions. It does <em>not</em> share that script's feature of notifying the managing object with a <code>TurnOn</code> message when a created object is picked up.</p>
