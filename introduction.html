		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>KDScript is a custom script module for the Dark Engine games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project">Thief: The Dark Project</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_II:_The_Metal_Age">Thief&nbsp;II: The Metal Age</a>. It provides access to the new script services available with the unofficial <a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141148">NewDark patch</a>, including dynamic weather and fog and nonlinear campaigns. It offers custom HUD elements including quest arrows, statistic meters, and tool sights. It also includes other useful features such as automatic subtitling of AI speech and voiceovers. The included mission demonstrates the scripts in this module; load this ZIP file as an FM to try it.</p>
		<p>This is version <strong>0.7.0</strong> of KDScript, released on <strong>2013-09-01</strong> as <code>KDScript&#8209;0.7.0.zip</code>. (See the <a href="history.html">version history</a> for what has changed.) <strong>This module is in a public beta testing phase,</strong> and the script specifications below may change prior to the first official version. If you are interested in using any of these scripts in your mission, please follow <a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141906">my announcements on TTLG</a> so you can have an up-to-date version. I would be glad to assist you in using these scripts and testing them in your mission; see my contact information below.</p>
		<p>This module owes its existence to Telliamed's robust base libraries and to our NewDark benefactor Le&nbsp;Corbeau. Thank you!</p>

		<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
		<p>This module works with one of the following games and engine versions on one of the following operating systems:</p>

		<p><strong>*</strong> A version of KDScript is available for use with Thief Gold (TG) and Thief: The Dark Project (T1/TDP). Not all of the scripts and features are available for these games; see individual scripts for details. <span class="important">Note that the module has not been tested with T1, only with TG.</span> The TG/T1 version of the module, along with a limited demo mission, is located in the <code>thief1</code> directory inside this ZIP file.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Using the scripts</h2>
		<p>To use these scripts while creating a mission, they must be available to the Dark Engine. Place the <code>KDScript.osm</code> and <code>ThiefLib.osl</code> files in your mission's root (main) directory, to be included in the distributed ZIP file. (No other files from the KDScript archive are required.)</p>
		<p>Next, open your mission in DromEd and add this module with the command <code>script_load KDScript</code>. You are now ready to add the scripts in this module to archetypes and objects.</p>
		<p>Many of these scripts are configured using <a href="parameters.html">Design Note parameters</a> in addition to standard properties and links. See that section for more details.</p>
		<p>The source code for <a href="https://github.com/kdau/KDScript">KDScript</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/kdau/ThiefLib">ThiefLib</a> support library are available on GitHub. This module is licensed under the GPL, which usually requires you to distribute it along with its source code. However, you may distribute the module in a fan mission without including the source; see the legal notes below.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions or issues related to these scripts, please post them in the <a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141906">KDScript thread on TTLG</a>, contact me by <a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=66136">private message on TTLG</a>, or email me at <code>&lt;kevin&nbsp;AT&nbsp;kdau&nbsp;DOT&nbsp;com&gt;</code>.</p>
